## Preparation

In the two weeks since the last meeting, I implemented selectors and ran some
tests. Incrementality generally showed very little difference in performance.
I also started reading the paper on MiniSat.


Make sat to unsat tests


Ipasir should be incremental



Results: Show what if we didn't have incremental sat solving
